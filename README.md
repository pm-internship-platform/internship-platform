✔️ Centralized styling with **style.css**

✔️ Organized asset storage inside `/src/images`

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is created as a **front-end template** to speed up web development.  
Instead of starting from scratch every time, developers can use this base project to:
- Quickly set up a structured front-end
- Reuse components like navigation bars and footers
- Extend the project with dynamic features and back-end integrations later
